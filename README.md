<h2>About Harman Cheema</h2>
<p><em>Get to know me!</em></p>

<p>My name is Harmanjit Kaur Cheema but I often go by the nickname of Harman! I am 23 years old and I grew up in Surrey, BC. I enjoy playing sports like soccer and basketball. I also have a big hobby for <a href="#fitness">fitness</a>, so in my spare time I enjoy to spend time by going to the gym and go outdoors! I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends! Most of my close family lives also in Surrey, BC so I often get to visit my cousins. My goal after my education with BCIT is to be able to have experience in an industry I enjoy! I have always loved to do creative work whenever an opportunity is given! I believe that this program will help me understand all the principles of graphic design so I can use them to my benefit in the future!</p>

<h2>My School Experience</h2>
<p>I graduated from Fleetwood Park Secondary School in 2019. After graduation, I decided to go to KPU for their BBusiness Management Diploma. Unfortunately, when covid happened things changed and school became online plus a lot more difficult to manage. So I decided to wait for a while to go back to school but I never ended up going back to KPU. After a couple years went by from just doing full time jobs, I thought about going back to school and wanted to go into Graphic Design. I did some research and found that BCIT was the best fit for me and I decided to register for this program that I am currently enrolled in!</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<h4>Painting</h4>
<p>I love painting! I have been painting since I was in elementry school. I would usually paint on canvas and started to paint on glass in high school. I do not have a lot of spare time right now to paint but I definitely want to start to paint again. I enjoy painting cartoons or characters from shows and movies! Hopefully I can get back to painting sometime! </p>

<h4>Baking</h4>
<p>Baking was one of my hobbies at an early age. I was always so excited to make cupcakes and cookies at home rather than buying them from the store. I have baked treats for birthdays as well! I had a dream to open up my own coffee shop cafe with my own style menu of pastries and treats! In high school, we had a pastry arts class and I had actually gotten an award for that class. It was a very proud moment. Sadly, once I graduated I went the path of Business School and sometimes I wonder where I would be if I went to pastry art school instead. I still have that dream and would like to pursue it but I guess right now is not the time for it. Soon though! </p>

<h4>Gaming</h4>
<p>I grew up with my older brother and a couple of older cousins, so I grew up playing video games and even card games! We all used to love playing so many fun games like Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros. I grew up with a lot of gaming consoles, some examples are Gamecube, Wii, PS2, Xbox 360, PS4 and many more! As I grew older, we played more of the multiplayer games like Call Of Duty and God Of War. I definitely do love the fact that I grew up with gaming consoles instead of other toys because I still to this day enjoy gaming with friends. As for card games, my brothers and I were big collectors on Yu-Gi-Oh cards and some Pokemon cards too. From time to time we still get together to play some Yu-Gi-Oh for fun! </p>

<h4>Watching shows</h4>
<p>I often usually do not watch shows but I do enjoy watching cartoons and anime! I was a big fan of some cartoons like Teen Titans and other shows similar to that. As for anime, I am a big fan of Bleach, Dragon Ball Z and Naruto! I have watched them all multiple times and to this day enjoy watching them in my spare time. I love the concept of all the different characters and the plots in all the shows. Hoping to watch more shows this year similar to those!</p>

<h4><a name="fitness">Fitness</a></h4>
I love fitness! I grew up playing club soccer and playing sports with my friends after school. Now, I enjoy hiking and going to the gym to stay active from my day to day busy life. I believe it is super important to stay active no matter how busy you are! My favourite way to spend time with friends is also by going on walks, go on a hike or play some sports for fun at the nearby park.
